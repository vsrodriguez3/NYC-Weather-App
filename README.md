# NYC-Weather-App

This is a simple project that uses the Open-Meteo API to display New York City's weather.

It shows current temperature in degrees Fahrenheit, precipitation, and wind speed in miles per hour. 

The weather icon changes based on weather condition. For example, if the sky is clear, there is a sun. If it is cloudy, it changes to clouds, and so forth. The weather condition is taken from the API.
